/*
# DOM = Document Object Model

A JavaScript Object that represents the page you in the web browser
and provides you with an API to interact with it.
A web browser constructs the DOM when it loads an HTML document,
and structures all the elements in a tree-like representation
JavaScript can access the DOM to dynamically change the content,
structure, and style of a web page.
